<div>
<p>This site is to display my present knowledge gathered to format/compile a very basic webpage. Further advancements will be added as and when I master them!</p>


<div class="box">
I'm not expecting this page to win design awards! All I'm attempting is to encompass some of the training I have developed over the last few months. Along with showing what the edition of <i>basic</i> CSS can do to the design of a web page. <br><br>

As with this box, it's added by typing into the CSS sheet <b>overflow:auto;</b>. If enough wording is added, then you would have to scroll down. It has its usage, news scrolling etc. Just as I'm attempting here to rabbit on, to prove the point! <br><br>

I've tried my best to keep the page as <i>semantically</i> correct as I know how to this stage. But, probably reading back in time I'll find a lot wrong with the mark-up! And the <i>wireframe</i> (layout) obviously needs some work ... but, I could spend forever here and do nothing else!
		<br><br>
This is an example of CSS the styling for this box: <br><br>
<b>
.box {<br>
float: right;<br>
width: 350px;<br>
height: 350px;<br>
background-color: cornflowerblue;<br>
font-family: consolas;<br>
font-size: 19px;<br>
color: yellow;<br>
overflow: auto;<br>
margin-bottom: 10px;<br>
margin-top: 5px;<br>
margin-left: 40px;<br>
padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;<br>
}</b>
		<br><br>
I consider I've now picked up the <i>fundamentals</i> of HTML5/CSS3 and I'm going to move forward with Javascript.<br><br>Javascript is a full programming language and not mark up, as is HTML. But, one cannot live without the other.<br><br>It really is: <strong>ALL A LOAD OF CODE!</strong><br>
		</div>

<p>This page is compiled <b>ONLY</b> with the techniques I've learnt so far.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>Meta Tag/Data</li>
	<li>Header/Body/Div Tags</li>
	<li>Paragraphs</li>
	<li>Formatting Text</li>
	<li>Unordered Lists</li>
	<li>Ordered Lists</li>
	<li>Images (folder and URL's)</li>
	<li>Forms</li>
	<li>Links</li>
	<li>Tables</li>
	<li>HTML Entities</li>
	<li>iFrames</li>
	<li><b>NEW</b> CSS Properties and Style Sheet</li>
	</ul>

<p>As I progress with my development, the plan is to improve this page so it steps forward from its turn of the century look!.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><strong>About Me</strong></h3>

<p>Initially raised eight years in Ghana. Educated in England, soon after, a spell in the military. Studied furniture design and crafts (traditional cabinetmaker). Followed by too many years as a sales representative for a timber importer.</p>

<p>Plenty other jobs in between: hotel porter, barman, beach-litter-picker, shelf stacker, motorcycle courier, the list goes on and on and on!</p>

<p>I've backpacked ten months round the world. Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, America, Canada, and back out through New York.</p>

<p>Then a new direction: trained as a commercial pilot in South Africa. I flew safaris in Namibia and Botswana, with a brief spell in Tanzania.</p>

</div>

<p>Next, I spent time (still am cycle touring) as a cycle adventurer round New Zealand and up through Tasmania. Between cycling, I managed a backpackers on the south island of New Zealand for a summer. Returning to England and completed a cycle around the rugged coast of my home county of Cornwall. Then enjoyed a glorious summers cycling up through Wales.</p>

<p>Now, I'm embarking on yet another adventure: to pursue a career as a 'Web Programmer'. And, the difference is: I'm starting mid-life! <strong>Enthusiasm = Learning!</strong></p>

<p>I'm fully aware that I'll need to work on a ‘portfolio' of projects. As relying on just training, <u>will not</u> be sufficient. This is where my first webpage comes into play. Why not start that train, by showing ones progression as a project for that said portfolio. Watch this space!</p>

<h3 class="h3"><strong>Ab Initio To Fully Fledged "Professional" Programmer!</strong></h3>

<p>So, where do you start? Choosing a route to follow... when lost, find a map! Click <a href="https://coggle.it/diagram/52e97f8c5a143de239005d1b/56212c4e4c505e0045c0d3bda59b77e5977c2c9bd40f3fd0b451bdcf8da4aa52" target="_blank"><strong>HERE.</strong></a></p>

<p>The bigger picture though, "what are companies looking for in the UK"? HTML5, CSS, Javascript. Then, ASP.net (C#) is showing up more often on recruitment sites.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT - Read up on what training requirements are necessary for your chosen route.</p>

To view the written code: Right click on this page, then left click <b><u>V</u>iew Page Source</b>. This will show the HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) only. The styling is done with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which is stored on another sheet (known as 'External CSS').

<p>* My cycling blog is not related in any way <u>presently</u> to my professional programming abilities (well, there is known!). The blog is written with 'Windows Live Writer', which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a> - 'What You See Is What You Get' and downloaded onto Wordpress. No coding of any kind, 'on my part', goes into it!
