            <p class="subtitle is-6">Born in Mauritius 21st October 1918, then a British colony.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">Amédée Maingard better known as Dédé, was studying (Economics and Finance) in London when WWII broke out. He volunteered for the British Army but was soon recruited for the French Section of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive" target="_blank">Special Operations Executive</a> <abbr title="Special Operations Executive">SOE</abbr>, the British wartime resistance organization.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">After extensive training, he parachuted into occupied France in 1943 to join the 'Stationer' circuit, initially as a radio operator but soon was second-in-command in the circuit, arranging the delivery of weapons, supplies and personnel to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance" target="_blank">Resistance</a>. After a year's clandestine work, he narrowly escaped the fate of his organiser who was captured by the Germans in May 1944.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">Undeterred, Dédé developed his own 'Shipwright' circuit in time to support the Forces Francaises de l'Interieure <abbr title="Forces Francaises de l'Interieure">FFI</abbr> and the arrival of fifty-five men of 1st <abbr title="Special Air Service">SAS</abbr> Regiment for the ill-fated <a href="http://amzn.to/2owozYD" target="_blank">Operation Bullbasket</a> shortly after D-Day.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">He continued his vital work until the liberation of central France, managing to keep the peace among the Gaullists, Communists, British and Americans fighting for the French common cause. He earned the Croix de Guerre from the French government in 1944 and the Distinguished Service Order from the British government in June 1945.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">Dédé returned to Mauritius and helped develop the island's tourism industry, founding <a href="https://www.airmauritius.com/index_gb.htm" target="_blank">Air Mauritius</a> in 1967. He became one of his country's most successful post-war businessmen.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6">Dédé died in 1981 at the age of 62, just before a boom in the tourist industry that he had helped establish.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-6"><em>"I'm grateful to Paul McCue (Amedee Maingard's biographer) for making this remarkable man's achievements in peace and war better known."</em></p>
