      <p>A PATH TO LEARNING CODE<br />
      <small>The greatest dilemma I've had by far, is: which language to launch with and which training provider to settle on?  Obviously, HTML and CSS are both mark-up languages and not languages per se in the real coding sense. Javascript being, a scripting language, we're getting close and this comes already installed on your browser. I like to call these, <strong>'The Goldilocks of Programming'</strong>. The absolute basics. So here's my present run-down of my training providers. This page is also to assist me within my own code development. The three 'Goldilocks' are here: HTML5, CSS3 and a smidging of Javascript to open this dialogue box. My path so far.</small></p>

    <div class="dash">
      <p>DASH - GENERAL ASSEMBLY<span class="price">free</span><br />
      <small>Dash came into my sights via Bento. After completing various courses, mostly through the training providers below, I was at a loss as to where to start or more importantly, what subject (web page) should I implement my newly acquired skills too. Again, this is another site that has given me some direction. Some of you might notice there is a resemblance to the course page 'Build your own business website'. One always needs a foundation, so this seemed a good a place as to start. I've tweaked the template and then played with the code using my newly acquired skills. As they say: BUILD then LEARN. It has also fired up my creative side, not a bad thing to have as an aspiring front-end-developer-bloke! A very cool introduction to the basics from General Assembly.</small><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank"><span class="name">dash</span></a></p>

    <div class="codecademy">
      <p>CODECADEMY<span class="price">free</span><br />
      <small>You might say, why not start with Codecademy, learn the basics, then move on. My reasoning was, surely it can't be as good as the paid up training providers, as it's free! Once again, thanks to Bento I gave it a go with HTML and CSS. Very impressed I was! Well laid out and challenges to get one thinking. A hint is always on hand if you get stuck. And again, covered something that I'd not come across before. If you're not willing to part with any cash just yet, a very worthy starting point. I'm looking forward to the Javascript path next. As it's free, you'd have to say, value-all-round for any fledgling developer.</small><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"><span class="name">codecademy</span></a></p>

    <div class="bento">
      <p>BENTO<span class="price">free</span><br />
      <small>I can't quite recall how I came across Bento, but glad I did. Probably Twitter? <strong>'Learning Tracks'</strong> is a super way to align some kind of direction in ones self-development training. With the assortment of videos and learning materials compiled by its author (Jon Chan) from various sources, who himself is a 'self-trained developer' (presently working for Stack Overflow). An excellent start for any newbie coder on the scene. Looking forward to the full completion of 'Learning Tracks' as it's still in beta. Top marks.</small><a href="https://www.bento.io/" target="_blank"><span class="name">bento</span></a></p>

    <div class="codeschool">
      <p>CODESCHOOL<span class="price">subscription</span><br />
      <small>Code School or Treehouse, that is the question? These are the two big players on the block. I like the idea of badges and points, it gives one a personal achievement goal. And, with self-study, you'll need it! I choose Code School initially as I found the lecturer's videos in Treehouse a bit cheesy. That was my decision criteria... no rocket science here! I'm not going to give Treehouse the kick though, as I'm starting to see a pattern emerging, I learn something new from each training provider. Code School's PATHS, are very good and their downloadable videos/slides are a worthy addition to any library, with each course having a different theme ... nice. Halting subscription for a time is a certain winner. An impressive school for any range of experience.</small><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank"><span class="name">codeschool</span></a></p>

    <div class="udemy">
      <p>UDEMY<span class="price">varies</span><br />
      <small>If you're looking for that cover-all-bases, then you'll not find a better course than <strong>The Complete Web Developer Course</strong> by Rob Percival. He covers everything from: HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, Wordpress and mobile apps. Download is available, but only to iPhone or iPad. Word of note: don't pay the full price for a course. Watch the Udemy site frequently or email subscribe. Reductions all the time. And don't just take the 65% off (like I did!). Wait, about once a month big offerings down to $10 to $20 for most courses. Excellent starting place and will give you a broad picture. A well structured and thought out course. A must.</small><a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank"><span class="name">udemy</span></a></p>

    <div class="lvs">
      <p>LEARN VISUAL STUDIO.NET<span class="price">membership</span><br />
      <small>Where to after my CS101 course, what language? But, knowing pretty much naught about languages, my thought process was, what am I used to? I've only ever used Microsoft computers, tablets and phones operating systems. So stick to a Microsoft product I thought! With that, I found, LVS.NET with Bob Tabor. I'm still unsure on the C# route but did find his intro videos to HTML and CSS very good. With that, I signed up for a life membership. More a, seems-like-a-good-deal-kind-a-thing-at-the-time! If I do go the C# ASP.NET route, a very worthy investment. All courses downloadable with tutor feedback. First class training and I highly recommend if you're looking for C# and ASP.NET as a career.</small><a href="http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/" target="_blank"><span class="name">learnvisualstudio.net</span></a></p>

    <div class="stanford">
      <p>STANFORD ONLINE<span class="price">free</span><br />
      <small>University courses I hear you say? All the big Uni's have very good courses available direct to your armchair now! Harvard, Rice, Stanford etc.. there all there. This particular course I took (Computer Science 101 with Nick Parlante) had already started and I had some catching up to do. A very simple course, but filled in the blanks regarding the overall picture regarding the internet and computers. All the course is downloadable and comes with a unverified certificate. A lot of the more serious university courses though are verified through certain visual (web-cam), identification verification etc. protocols. Look through the schools, plenty of options. Excellent introduction for me and wetted my appetite for more.</small><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><span class="name">stanford online</span></a></p>
